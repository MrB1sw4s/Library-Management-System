# Library-Management-System
A small project under development


Problem Architecture: 

-->Requires the user's login and password if they are not already registered and stores them in a file. If the user is about to log in, check the file base for the username and password. 

--> Add a student to your library's membership list. 

--> Saves information such as the student's name, ID, books issued, and data issued. 

--> Requests that books be issued and removes books that have been returned to the library. 

--> Indicates whether the checked-out book has adequate time to return to its original location. 

--> Displays all student information, which is only a click away from clicking "Enter"!* 

-> After logging in, displays the login credentials. 

--> Change the password for a specific Username if desired. 

--> You can leave the gateway at any time.
